Simple authoring: • Is limited to the most common types of fields: • Text input (All Text fields are flagged as Required) • Signature • Signer's name (Printed) • Signer's email • Signature date (Read-Only; Supplied by the system) • Checkbox • Places fields anywhere you click on the document. • Allows resizing of fields by clicking the bottom right corner of the field (blue triangle) and dragging the field to size. 2. Advanced Authoring can be enabled by selecting the toggle in the upper right corner.

It could be a paper form or PDF that hasn’t been optimized for form filling. The Fill & Sign tool automatically detects the form fields like text fields, comb fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons. You can manually add text and other symbols anywhere on the form using the Fill & Sign tool if required. You can complete the forms by entering information and adding your signatures. Acrobat also allows you to send your completed forms to others and securely save them in Adobe cloud storage. Fill and sign PDF forms To complete and sign PDF forms, open the form in Acrobat and then select E-Sign from the global bar. Alternatively, you can select All tools > Fill & Sign. It displays the Fill & Sign tools in the left pane. You can now fill in the form fields and sign the form using the sign tools described in the following topics. To fill text fields: 1. From the left panel, select Fill in form fields , and then select the field where you want to add text. It displays a text field along with a toolbar. 2. Select the text field again and enter your text. 3. To reposition the text box to align it with the text field, select the textbox and hover over it. Once you see a plus icon with arrows, move the textbox to the desired position. 4. To edit the text, select the text box. Once you see the cursor and keypad, edit the text and then click elsewhere to enter. 5. To change the text size, select A or A as required.",
